# ColabCode

Run code server on Google Colab or Kaggle Notebooks

Quickstart:
- install colabcode: `pip install colabcode`
- import colabcode: `from colabcode import ColabCode`
- run: `ColabCode(port=10000)`
- you can also run it with any password or port :)


`ColabCode` has the following arguments:
- `port`: the port you want to run code-server on, default 10000
- `mount_drive`: True or False to mount your Google Drive

`ColabCode` comes pre-installed with some VS Code extensions.
